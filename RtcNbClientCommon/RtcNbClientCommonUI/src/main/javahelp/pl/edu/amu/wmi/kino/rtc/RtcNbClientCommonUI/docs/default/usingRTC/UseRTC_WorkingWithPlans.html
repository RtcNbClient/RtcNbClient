  You can create
  plans for a product release, team release, and iteration. Plans
  generally show a brief overview of the significant goals and all
  the work items for a release or an iteration. Use the Planned
  Items page to view and manage work items and team loads for the
  plan. Review progress using charts or using the progress
  indicators on the Planned Items page and in other views.

    <span class="notetitle">Note:</span> In a Scrum process, a
    Project Release plan is called Product Backlog, a Team Release
    plan is called Team Backlog, and an Iteration plan is called
    Sprint Backlog.

      management</a></strong><br />
      Team leads and team members can use plans to manage their
      work items that are planned for completion for a release,
      backlog, or an iteration. As work items are created, they are
      assigned to a category. A team lead later assigns the work
      item to a milestone. Plans can be associated with a team area
      or project area. If the work item categories are associated
      with a team, Jazz&trade; displays work items in the
      responsible team's plan based on the work item's category and
      planned iteration settings. If the work item category is not
      associated with a team area, a project area is used.</li>

      <li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href=
      "../topics/c_plan_types.html">Plans</a></strong><br />
      You can use plans to manage work items within the context of
      fixed development periods within a project. You can create a
      plan overview, create and modify work items assignments for
      team members, track the progress of the work that is
      committed for the iteration, and create additional
      documentation. <span class="keyword">Rational Team
      Concert&trade;</span> projects are organized into a series of
      fixed-length development periods called iterations. Each
      timeline has its own set of iterations. Timeline, iterations,
      start and end dates, and the current iteration designation
      are defined in the project area overview Process Iterations
      list.</li>
