  <h1 class="topictitle1">Rational Products overview</h1>
  <p class="p">IBM&#174; Rational&#174; provides a full range of
  offerings to ensure software and systems delivery success through
  practical, reliable, and extensible components. Designed with the
  needs of business users in mind, Rational&#174; offerings provide
  flexible, time-saving technologies that are developed for
  immediate productivity, high-fidelity results, and cost-savings.
  With Rational offerings users can consistently deliver assets to
  meet and exceed business commitments. Whether you work as an
  individual contributor or as a member of a team, Rational
  offerings meet your needs with powerful technologies optimized
  for competitive success.</p>
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Architecture management</h2>Model,
  design, and rapidly build resilient architectures for
  services-oriented architecture (SOA), systems and applications.
  The need for architecture management becomes critical when
  designing, developing and delivering complex software in a world
  where applications are increasingly more modular and complex.
  Rational provides industry-leading architecture management tools
  for architecture and design modeling, model-driven development,
  component testing, and static and runtime analysis activities. 
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Change and release
  management</h2>Improve software delivery and life-cycle
  traceability from requirements through deployment. Rational
  offers comprehensive, integrated build, change, and release
  management products for successful software delivery. These
  solutions help software and systems delivery teams within small
  and midsized businesses accelerate delivery and manage their
  end-to-end software processes, all within budget. 
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Integrated requirements
  management</h2>Define and manage requirements and provide
  traceability and alignment with business processes. Integrated
  requirements management is more than defining and managing
  requirements; instead, it means making requirements part of the
  full development life-cycle and linking the requirements directly
  to the business. Real integrated requirements management means
  that the software you deliver meets the real needs of the
  business users. 
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Process and portfolio
  management</h2>Align business goals, best practices, and projects
  for improved productivity and predictability. Use Rational
  process and portfolio management products to manage the
  development process, including software project management,
  managing resource use and project cost management, project scope
  tracking, and development progress measurement. Rational
  solutions provide portfolio dashboards, project management best
  practices, and asset life-cycle management capabilities that
  bridge the gap between development and operations. IBM has the
  proven expertise to help facilitate the organizational
  transformation to align IT with business objectives and establish
  best practices for project and portfolio management. 
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Quality management</h2>Demand software
  functionality, reliability, and performance in development and
  production. As new business challenges arise and technology
  complexity increases, it is clear that testing plays a much
  larger role in the success of applications for all businesses,
  especially for small and midsized companies. Rational provides
  efficient, cost-effective solutions for delivery of high quality,
  secure, and compliant Web-based software, packaged applications
  software, and in house applications that are optimized to improve
  the responsiveness and flexibility of small and midsized
  businesses.
