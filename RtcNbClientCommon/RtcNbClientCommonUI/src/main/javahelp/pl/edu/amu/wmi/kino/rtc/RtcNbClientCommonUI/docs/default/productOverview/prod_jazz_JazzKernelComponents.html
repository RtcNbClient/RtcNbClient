  <h1 class="topictitle1">Jazz kernel components</h1>The 
   <span class="keyword">Jazz&#8482; technology
  platform </span> kernel includes the repository and team process
  components. 
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Repository component</h2>
  <p class="p">Most application lifecycle tools store tool-specific
  information in a central place where it can be made available to
  all team members. Jazz provides this facility in an extensible
  repository. The Repository component is in the kernel, so its
  facilities are available to other components in all client and
  server configurations.</p>
  <p class="p">Each item in the repository has a unique item id,
  which can be used as a key to retrieve it. In fact, the item ids
  are universally unique identifiers (UUIDs), so that an item
  created in one repository can be replicated to another repository
  and retain its identity. Similarly, item states and content
  values are assigned universally unique identifiers, so that any
  state of an item can be replicated to other repositories and
  retain its identity.</p>
  <p class="p">Repository read and write operations are atomic. The
  server-side APIs also include an operation for explicitly
  bracketing an arbitrary sequence of read and write operations
  into a single atomic transaction. Jazz has server-side API for
  streaming content objects to and from the repository, designed so
  that the streaming can be done safely outside of a repository
  transaction.</p>
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Team Process component</h2>
  <p class="p">The Team Process component is the foundation of
  process support in the 
   <span class="keyword">Jazz technology platform </span> . In this
  context, process refers to the collection of practices, rules,
  guidelines, and conventions that a team uses to organize their
  work. For a very small team, the process is usually informal and
  undocumented. As a team grows, parts of the process may get
  documented on the team's project home page so that new team
  members can absorb them quickly. A large organization may have
  written descriptions of the general practices and procedures
  their project teams are expected to follow; a project team is
  expected to start with standard process templates and customize
  them to suit the project and team. Some organizations and teams
  go one step further, and create formal models covering
  significant portions of their processes.</p>
  <div class="p">Jazz supports process in several ways: 
  <ul class="ul">
    <li class="li">The 
     <span class="keyword">Jazz technology platform </span> is
    process-aware. In general, a team's process can affect any
    aspect of the work a team member does. The notion of process is
    designed in to the 
     <span class="keyword">Jazz technology platform </span> . The
    team's process is explicitly represented, and all the work that
    team members do within the system happens within the context of
    the process.</li>
    <li class="li">Jazz components are process-enabled. All Jazz
    components, including the initial core, have been designed to
    allow the prevailing process to exert influence over the
    component's operations and items.</li>
    <li class="li">The 
     <span class="keyword">Jazz technology platform </span> represents
    the process using standard Jazz items which are stored in the
    repository. This process representation can describe processes
    of all kinds, and can capture and enact as much (or as little)
    of the team's process as practical.</li>
    <li class="li">The 
     <span class="keyword">Jazz technology platform </span> is
    process-neutral. Jazz itself has no built in process enforcing
    what is done on any particular occasion. It's left up to the
    team to define an appropriate governing process to make such
    decisions for their project. This release includes several
    process templates, including a version of the one encapsulating
    the process used by the Jazz project team itself.</li>
