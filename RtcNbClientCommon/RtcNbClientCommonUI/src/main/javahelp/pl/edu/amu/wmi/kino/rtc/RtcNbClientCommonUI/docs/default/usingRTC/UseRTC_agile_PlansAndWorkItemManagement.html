  Team
  leads and team members can use plans to manage their work items
  that are planned for completion for a release, backlog, or an
  iteration. As work items are created, they are assigned to a
  category. A team lead later assigns the work item to a milestone.
  Plans can be associated with a team area or project area. If the
  work item categories are associated with a team, Jazz&trade;
  displays work items in the responsible team's plan based on the
  work item's category and planned iteration settings. If the work
  item category is not associated with a team area, a project area
  is used.

  <p class="p">Before beginning work on a plan, define the
  timelines, iterations, team areas, and work item categories for
  your project. If you do not have team areas, you can create a
  plan for a project area.</p>

  <p class="p">The following figure outlines the relationship of
  how categories, team areas, and iteration schedules help assign
  work items to the appropriate team and plan. With these
  relationships, team members can view and manage work items for
  all iterations within their corresponding plans. The steps for
  creating and using a plan are presented in the topics in this
  section of the help.</p>
