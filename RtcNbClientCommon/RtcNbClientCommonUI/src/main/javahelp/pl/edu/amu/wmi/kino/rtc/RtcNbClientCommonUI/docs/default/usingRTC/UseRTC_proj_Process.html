  <h1 class="topictitle1">Process</h1>Process is the collection of
  roles, practices, rules, and guidelines used to organize and
  control the flow of work. The project process is defined in a
  project area and can be further customized in a team area. In
  Jazz&trade;, you use process to define user roles and their
  permissions for performing operations within the tool, such as
  changing the state of a work item. Because each component in Jazz
  is process aware, you can add rules of process behavior in the
  form of preconditions and follow-up actions for these operations.
  Process can also define project reports, queries, and work item
  types.

  <p class="p"></p>

  <p class="p">Your process will vary with the complexity of the
  project and the size and number of teams assigned to the project.
  Jazz includes process templates that you can adopt and customize.
  Your team can begin with a simple process and evolve it as the
  project progresses. If you have customized the process, you can
  create a new process template and make it available to other
  teams. Process templates can include an informal description of
  the specified process.</p>

  <div class="p">
    Jazz supports process in the following ways:

    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Jazz is process-aware. The process is
      explicitly represented, and all the work that team members do
      within the system happens within a context of a defined
      process.</li>

      <li class="li">Jazz components are process-enabled. Process
      can be implemented to exert influence over each component's
      operations and artifacts.</li>

      <li class="li">Jazz is process-neutral. Each project team can
      define an appropriate level of control and guidance.</li>

      <li class="li">Process is hierarchical. The general
      project-wide process is defined at the project level. The
      process can then be modified to meet the needs of team areas
      within the project. At each level within the team hierarchy
      the parent process can define how much flexibility its child
      teams have to override or otherwise modify the process for
      their needs.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="p">
    Frequently, there is no single process that applies to all team
    members and all phases of a project. You can use process
    behavior to customize the process in specific team areas and
    iterations. The project process specification addresses
    project-wide, team, and role-specific behavior and permissions:

    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Client-side and server-side project
      initialization</li>

      <li class="li">Predefined project reports and queries</li>

      <li class="li">Work item types, workflows, and
      enumerations</li>

      <li class="li">Roles available for a team</li>

      <li class="li">Team and role-specific permissions for client
      and server-side operations</li>

      <li class="li">Team and role-specific preconditions that
      define the conditions under which client-side and server-side
      operations are allowed to proceed</li>

      <li class="li">Team and role-specific follow-up actions for
      client-side and server-side operations</li>
    </ul>
