 <h1 class="topictitle1">Rational Requirements Composer</h1>

  <p class="p">Rational Requirements Composer provides a platform for lean requirements practices involving a large set of stakeholders and team members in defining, analyzing and using requirements across the project lifecycle.</p>

  <p class ="p"> Projects rarely rise above the quality of their requirements. Effectively engaging stakeholders -- early and often -- in defining and validating requirements improves the likelihood that projects will deliver what customers need. This is true whatever the project methodology (waterfall, iterative or agile) and whatever the names of requirements artifacts (stories, use cases, functional and non-functional requirements, etc.).</p>

  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Understanding client needs and defining good requirements</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>TMany kinds of artifacts are needed to express requirements and related organizational context and constraints; these artifacts are created in various tools and data formats. They can be almost anything: spreadsheets, presentations, snapshots of whiteboard sessions, or recordings from Web conferences. Requirements Composer provides a way to bring these "information islands" together, relate them with hyperlinks, tags, attributes, and collections, have conversations around them, and evolve them as the team develops greater understanding of the real, important requirements.</li>
      <li>As a project team defines what it needs to accomplish, Requirements Composer helps the team naturally move from unstructured ideas expressed in presentations, pictures and documents to structured, actionable requirements expressed as stories, use cases, declarative requirements, work items and tests.</li>
      <li>Requirements Composer includes editors for use cases, user interface sketches and storyboards, process diagrams, rich text documents, and integrated glossaries. Analysts and others who author documents have all of these tools available, with similar user interfaces, in one location, using a common repository.</li>
      <li>User interface storyboards provide a way to express user scenarios intuitively, much like movie producers use storyboards to communicate concepts before filming begins. In Requirements Composer sketches and storyboards employ reusable parts, which can dramatically reduce the effort required to build storyboards and ensures consistency when modifying a group of wireframe mock-ups. </li>
      <li>MA Web client allows easy access for stakeholders and occasional users to view, review, comment on, and approve requirements artifacts and sets of artifacts.</li>
