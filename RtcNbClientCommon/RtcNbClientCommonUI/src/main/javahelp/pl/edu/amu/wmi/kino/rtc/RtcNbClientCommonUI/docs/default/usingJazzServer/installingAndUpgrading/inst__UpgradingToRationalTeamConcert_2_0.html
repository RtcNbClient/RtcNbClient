  <h1 class="topictitle1">Upgrading to 
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team
  Concert </span> 2.0</h1>Generally, you can upgrade 
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert&#8482; </span> clients
  and servers by either performing a zip or IBM&#174; Installation
  Manager install. 
  <div class="note">
   <span class="notetitle">Note: </span> If you use the IBM
  Installation Manager to install 
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert </span> 2.0 on a
  computer where 
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert </span> is not
  currently installed, the Installation Manager prompts you to
  select the languages to install. However if you update from an
  earlier version to 2.0, the IBM Installation Manager assumes that
  you want to use the current languages and does not prompt you to
  select languages. To select the additional languages, after you
  update to 2.0, select 
   <span class="uicontrol">Modify </span> from the main screen in the
  IBM Installation Manager, then select the offering. The next
  screen shows the list of supported languages. Select the ones you
  need. 
  <div class="p">If you start the Jazz&#8482; Team Server after you
  update to 2.0 and before you select 
   <span class="uicontrol">Modify </span> to add or remove languages,
  you must reset the server as follows: 
  <ol class="ol">
    <li class="li">In a Web browser, navigate to https:// 
    <var class="varname">
    server-host</var>:9443/jazz/admin.action=com.ibm.team.repository.admin.serverReset.</li>
    <li class="li">Click 
     <span class="uicontrol">Request Server Reset </span> .</li>
    <li class="li">Shut down the server.</li>
  </ol></div>
  <p class="p">Then you can select 
   <span class="uicontrol">Modify </span> in the IBM Installation
  Manager to add or remove languages.</p></div>
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Upgrading a 
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert </span> Client for
  Eclipse IDE</h2>
  <p class="p">If you have 1.0, 1.0.1, or 1.0.1.1 versions of the
  Client for Eclipse IDE, it is required that you obtain the 2.0
  client to connect to your new version 2.0 server. You can install
  this using a zip file, or you can update your prior IBM
  Installation Manager installs.</p>
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Installing a 
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert </span> Client for
  Microsoft Visual Studio IDE</h2>
  <div class="p">If you have 1.0.1.1 version of the Client for
  Microsoft&#174; Visual Studio IDE, it is required that you obtain
  the 2.0 client to connect to your new version 2.0 server. 
  <div class="note remember">
   <span class="remembertitle">Remember: </span> A .zip file is not
  provided for the Client for Microsoft Visual Studio. To install
  or upgrade to version 2.0, you must use IBM Installation
  Manager.</div></div>
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Upgrading a Server from a Trial or Early
  Access release to a Permanent release</h2>
  <p class="p">If you are running an Early Access release of 
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert </span> , first upgrade
  to the 2.0 Trial release.</p>
  <p class="p">From the 2.0 Trial release, you can make your server
  Permanent by purchasing and installing the Server Activation Kit
  for your edition, which is available here: 
  <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">

    <param name="content"
    value="http://www.ibm.com/software/awdtools/rtc/" />
    <param name="text"
    value="http://www.ibm.com/software/awdtools/rtc/ " />
  </object>. The activation kit consists of a JAR file containing
  the Permanent server key. It is installed using the License Key
  Management page of your server's administrative Web
  interface.</p>
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Upgrading a Server from 1.0, 1.0.1, or
  1.0.1.1</h2>
  <p class="p">You can upgrade directly to the 2.0 release of 
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert </span> from the
  previous releases. A database migration is required for 1.x to
  2.x updates.</p>
  <div class="note">
   <span class="notetitle">Note: </span> Before you begin upgrading a
  WebSphere&#174; Application Server, reset the server by
  navigating to 
   <span class="filepath">
  https://servername:9443/jazz/admin#action=com.ibm.team.repository.admin.serverReset </span> and
  clicking 
   <span class="uicontrol">Request Server Reset </span> .</div>
  <p class="p">If you installed the previous release from a zip
  file, then there is no intersection with the previous install.
  You can install the 2.0 release from a zip in a new location, or
  you can use the IBM Installation Manager to install an instance
  of 2.0.</p>
  <p class="p">If you used IBM Installation Manager to install the
  previous release, you can either install 2.0 as a separate
  instance or update the previous instance to 2.0. If you install a
  separate instance of the server for the 2.0 release, select 
   <span class="uicontrol">Create a new package group </span> on the 
   <span class="wintitle">Install Packages </span> page of the
  installation wizard.</p>
  <div class="note">
   <span class="notetitle">Note: </span> To upgrade a WebSphere
  Application Server deployment of the 
   <span class="keyword">Jazz Team Server </span> , remove the

  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Upgrading a Server from one 
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert </span> edition to
  another</h2>
  <p class="p">You can upgrade between 
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert </span> editions.
  Typical upgrades include moving from Express-C to Express&#8482;,
  or Express to Standard. You can also downgrade in the opposite
  direction by following the same process.</p>
  <p class="p">Because all 
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert </span> 2.0 editions
  support Derby databases, you do not need to migrate from Derby to
  DB2&#174; or Oracle if you are moving from Express-C to Express
  or Standard. We recommend that you migrate your server edition
  first, make sure things work smoothly with the existing database,
  and then perform a database migration if required. For
  information on performing a database migration, see 
  <a class="xref"
  href="../migrating/mig__MigratingJazzRepositoryAfterUpgradingJazz.html"

  Server</a>.</p>
  <p class="p">If you have installed a 
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert </span> 2.0 edition and
  want to upgrade to another, download and install the new edition,
  alongside the existing edition, and then copy the required
  configuration files to run the new edition. The section below
  describes the configuration files that you require.</p>
  <p class="p">If you installed your previous edition from a zip
  file, then there is no intersection with the previous install.
  You can install the new edition from a zip in a new location, or
  you can use the IBM Installation Manager install for the new
  edition. We recommend that the IBM Installation Manager be used
  for production servers to enable future updates to be
  applied.</p>
  <p class="p">If you used IBM Installation Manager to perform your
  previous server install, and want to use IBM Installation Manager
  to install your new edition, during the new Installation Manager
  install, do not overlay the previous edition. On the 
   <span class="wintitle">Install Packages </span> page of the
  installation wizard, select 
   <span class="uicontrol">Create a new package group </span> .</p>
  <p class="p">This will install the new edition in a different
  location and create program shortcuts using the new package group
  name.</p>
  <div class="p">If you do not perform this task, the installation
  will fail with a file collision. This occurs if you see an error
  dialog titled 
  <tt class="systemoutput">Installation Failed</tt>, and the
  details show the following text: 
  <pre class="pre">
Installation failed.
  Error during "install" phase:
    Failed to extract zip standard 1.0.1.I20081018-1820.  File
    D:\JazzTeamServer\server\license-update-site\site.xml already
exists.

  <p class="p">If this occurs, it is not fatal; you can restart the
  installation and correctly create a new package group.</p>
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">WebSphere Application Server
  configuration updates</h2>
  <div class="p">The following steps are required to properly
  configure WebSphere Application Server in 
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert </span> 2.0. 
  <ol class="ol">
    <li class="li">Ensure that the latest fix packs for WAS and

  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Copying the required configuration files
  from a previous server installation</h2>
  <p class="p">Copy the following files from the source server to
  the target server. First, rename the original files in the
  upgraded server install to create backups. If you used the IBM
  Installation Manager to update from 1.0, 1.0.1, or 1.0.1.1 to
  2.0, a backup directory containing your 1.0.x configuration files
  was created with a name, such as 
   <span class="filepath">backup-config-

  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Setting a project timeline</h2>
  <p class="p">In 
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert </span> 1.x, projects
  could have multiple timelines (previously called "development
  lines") and all of these timelines were considered equal.</p>
  <p class="p">In

  can still have multiple timelines, but one of them can be marked
  as the "project timeline". When migrating your database to 2.0,
  the project's primary timeline is not known, so your projects
  will not have a project timeline set. You can manually update
  your projects to set the project timeline, after you upgrade to
  2.0</p>
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Configuring the Source Control
  snapshot</h2>
  <p class="p">The Source Control Management (SCM) snapshot for the
  Data Warehouse collects data on streams, including information
  about the size of streams and the activity (change set and
  file/folder changes) within it. In version 1.0, this snapshot
  automatically collected information about all streams. As this
  can be a costly operation, in version 2.0, the configurability
  options are added to the SCM snapshot to let the users decide for
  which streams the data should be collected. The immediate impact
  of this change is that, unless you configure it, no data will be
  collected.</p>
  <div class="p">To configure the SCM snapshot: 
  <ol class="ol">
    <li class="li">You must have write permissions for the stream
    that you want to collect data for.</li>
    <li class="li">Go to the

    <li class="li">In the left navigation panel, select 
     <span class="uicontrol">Administer SCM Snapshot </span> . A list

  </ol></div>
  <p class="p">Data will be collected for the selected streams in
  all subsequent snapshots.</p>
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Incompatible changes to BIRT
  reports</h2>
  <div class="p">If you have used the BIRT report designer to
  create your own report templates, you may run into one or more
  problems when trying to use these reports in version 2.0. You
  should be aware of the following issues: 
  <ul class="ul">
    <li class="li">Changes to the order in which Java and
    JavaScript classes are resolved. If you have written JavaScript
    code in your BIRT report which uses the 
    <samp class="codeph">importPackage() </samp>statement to import
    the 
    <samp class="codeph">java.lang </samp>package, be aware that
    unqualified references to Object in the code, which used to
    refer to the Java class, may now refer to the JavaScript class
    (and as a result won't work properly). Other classes which are
    identically named between JavaScript and Java, such as 
    <samp class="codeph">java.util.Date </samp>, may have the same
    problem. The solution is to fully qualify your reference to the
    Java class and remove the 
    <samp class="codeph">importPackage() </samp>statement.</li>
    <li class="li">Changes to the processing of data sets. In the
    past, the simple act of binding an element (such as a Label) to
    a data sets, caused the data set to be processed in its
    entirety when the element was rendered. This was handy because
    it meant one could enforce an ordering to data set processing
    by using (hidden) labels bound to the data sets in the order
    they should be processed. Now, such a binding will process only
    the first row of the data set. To get the previous behavior,
    use a Dynamic Text element and invoke some JavaScript code
    which will force processing of the entire data set. 
    <samp class="codeph">Total.count() </samp>is a good choice.</li>
    <li class="li">BIRT report designer bugs can cause loss of
    data. These problems appear when you open a BIRT report design
    file created in BIRT 2.2.2 (i.e. RTC 1.0) with the BIRT 2.3.2
    (i.e. RTC 2.0) report designer. The following issues have been
    observed: 
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">When editing a data set for the first time
      with BIRT 2.3.2, on the "Parameters" page, the "Default
      Value" and "Report Parameter" fields may be lost. The
      workaround is to re-enter the values, or to copy and paste
      the values from a previous version of the editor. After
      saving the file with the new values entered, the problem will
      not recur.</li>
      <li class="li">When editing a report design file for the
      first time with BIRT 2.3.2, the default value for report
      parameters may be lost. This may also occur after the
      previous problem described. The workaround is to re-enter the
      values, or to copy and paste the values from a previous
      version of the editor. After saving the file with the new
      values entered, the problem will not recur.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p">These issues can be very serious if not noticed,
    as the data gathered by the report could be incorrect. It is a
    good practice to check each data set and each report parameter
    when editing a report for the first time with the BIRT 2.3.2
    report designer. These problems do not occur for new reports
    that are created with the BIRT 2.3.2 tools.</p>
    <p class="p">The above changes are made to all 
     <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert </span> 2.0
    out-of-the-box reports - no action is required on your part.
    However, if you have manually created report templates in your
    project area using our out-of-the-box reports, and have not
    specified an appropriate identifier (consistent with our
    usage), your report template will not be refreshed when it is
    migrated. That is, the content will be out of date, and will
    not work. In that case, you should upload new content for the
    affected templates, using the appropriate out-of-the-box 
    <samp class="codeph">.rptdesign </samp>file.</p></li>
  </ul></div>
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Import of the Work Items data in the
  data warehouse</h2>
  <p class="p">In 
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert </span> 2.0, there are
  several schema changes to the work items tables in the data
  warehouse. As a consequence, when migrating from 1.0 to 2.0, the
  importer will ignore any warehoused work items data. As a result,
  when you start the 2.0 server for the first time, your work items
  reports may not function correctly. The workaround is either to
  wait for the work items snapshot to run for the first time, or to
  manually cause it to run after you start the server. On the first
  run after migration, the work items snapshot will reconstitute
  the entire historical work items information in the data
  warehouse. This also means that the first run of the snapshot
  after migration is likely to take much longer than an average
  nightly run.</p>
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Discovering new reports</h2>
  <div class="p">In 
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert </span> 2.0, several
  new reports are added. While these reports appear in the new
  process templates that ship with the product, they are not
  automatically added to the existing project areas on migration.
  We have added a new action that will help you to discover and
  deploy these new report templates in your existing project areas
  after migration. To deploy new report templates: 
  <ol class="ol">
    <li class="li">In the rich client, open the 
     <span class="uicontrol">Team Artifacts </span> view.</li>
    <li class="li">Expand your project area, expand 
     <span class="uicontrol">Reports </span> .</li>
    <li class="li">Right-click 
     <span class="uicontrol">Report Templates </span> and select 
     <span class="uicontrol">Deploy New Templates </span> .</li>
  </ol></div>
  <p class="p">The dialog will help you to discover any report
  templates which are available but not already deployed to your
  project area. You may select one or more of them and they will be
  created. After creation, you may create new reports from those
  templates using the available menu actions.</p>
  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Customizations</h2>
  <p class="p">Changes that you make to work item types,
  attributes, workflows, roles, and event handlers are preserved
  when you upgrade from 1.x to 2.0. If you customized a predefined
  process template (such as Scrum), be aware that if you redeploy
  the predefined template (in the Process Templates view), you will
  overwrite your customizations. If you need to redeploy the
  predefined template, you should first change the name and ID of
  the predefined template that you customized, so it will not be
  overwritten.</p>
