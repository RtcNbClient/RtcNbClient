  A plan
  typically consists of a series of iterations and each iteration
  consists of work items that are scheduled to be completed within
  an iteration. You provide the estimate for each work item. Given
  the number of work items and their estimates within the duration
  of an iteration, work items can be categorized from very probably
  to improbably able to complete in an iteration. The Schedule Risk
  Assessment plan helps in determining the work items that might go
  in or slip away in an iteration.

  <p class="p">The Schedule Risk Assessment plan is available only
  for the Standard and Enterprise edition of <span class=
  "keyword">Rational Team Concert&trade;</span>.</p>

  <p class="p">The Schedule Risk Assessment plan displays the risk
  assessment for each team member of a team area or project area.
  The work items in the plan are sequenced in the same order as in
  the Current Work section of the <span class="wintitle">My
  Work</span> view. The risk assessment is calculated in the same
  sequence. The work items in the Inbox folder are not assessed for
  risk.</p>

  <p class="p">In the Schedule Risk Assessment plan, in addition to
  the original estimate, you can provide a minimal and maximal
  estimate. <span class="ph" id=
  "scheduleriskassessedplan__ph1"><a name=
  "scheduleriskassessedplan__ph1" id=
  "scheduleriskassessedplan__ph1"></a>If the minimal estimate is
  not provided, the original estimate is divided by 2 to get the
  minimal estimate. Similarly, if the maximum estimate is not
  provided, the original estimate is multiplied by 2 to get the
  maximal estimate. These estimates are used to simulate the
  probability of work items being completed on time.</span></p>
