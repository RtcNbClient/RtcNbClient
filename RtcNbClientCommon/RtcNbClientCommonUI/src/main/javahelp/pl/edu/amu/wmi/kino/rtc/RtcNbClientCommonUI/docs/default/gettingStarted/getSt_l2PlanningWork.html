    <h1 class="topictitle1">Planning work of your team</h1>
    <p class="p">In this section, you will create a plan.</p>
    <p class="p">Teams that follow agile methods, such as Scrum, typically divide their release schedule into a series of fixed-length development iterations, with fixed end dates. Planning for these iterations involves scheduling the work to be done during an iteration and assigning elements of that work to members of the team. To be effective, plans need to be accessible to everyone on the team and they need to change dynamically over the course of the iteration to reflect the team's position and direction.</p>
    <p class="p">In Jazzâ„¢, the planning component provides tools to assist with the planning and execution of development iterations. The approach is simple: plans are composed of work items that match certain criteria. Treating plans as a set of work items has the following useful characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Plans are live:
            <ul>
                 <li>Changing work items changes the plan. For example, closing a work item marks the work item as done on the plan, without need for further explicit actions. </li>
                  <li>Changing the plan directly changes the work items, or creates new work items if necessary. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Plans can be viewed in many ways. A plan can easily be regrouped by owner, functional category, duration, or any other criteria that is available on work items. </li>
        <li> Plans are available to everyone on the team. </li>
      </ul>

    <h2 class="sectiontitle">Creating a new plan</h2>
    <p class="p">You can create different types of plans for a project; such as a Project Release plan, Team Release plan, and Iteration plan  . For more information about these plans, see the topics on each plan.</p>
    <div class="note">Note: If you follow the Scrum process template, a Project Release plan is called a Product Backlog plan, a Team Release plan  is called a Team Backlog plan, and an Iteration plan  is called a Sprint Backlog plan.</div>
    <p class="p">To create plan:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In the Web UI, click <span class="keyword">Plans.</span></li>
        <li>Click Create <span class="keyword">Plan.</span>></li>
        <li>Complete following steps:
            <ul><li>Type plan name, such us Prelude</li>
                <li>Ensure that the Plan Type is set to Sprint Backlog. </li>
                <li>Ensure that the Team area is named Team 1, created by Jazz during the project area creation. </li>
                <li>Ensure that the Iteration field is set to Sprint 1 (1.0). </li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Click Save.</li>
              
    </ol>
     <p class="p">You have now created a new iteration plan that will include all the work items assigned to Team 1 that targets the milestone Sprint 1 (1.0). For now, none of the work items are assigned to that milestone and team yet. We'll perform that task in the following sections.</p>
