  <h1 class="topictitle1">Project area</h1><a name="conbody" id=
  "conbody"></a>The project area is the system's representation of
  a software project. The project area defines the project
  deliverables, team structure, process, and schedule.

  <p class="p">A project area is stored as a top-level or root item
  in a repository. A project area references project artifacts and
  stores the relationships between these artifacts. Access to a
  project area and its artifacts is controlled by permissions. A
  project area cannot be deleted from the repository; however, it
  can be archived, which places it in an inactive state.</p>

  <p class="p"></p>

  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Project deliverables as lines of
  development</h2>

  <div class="p">
    A project can be quite simple or complex in terms of its
    committed product deliverables, process, and schedules. An
    established project can have multiple active lines of
    development, known as <em class="i">timelines</em>, such as:

    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Maintenance for one or more shipped
      releases</li>

      <li class="li">Development of a new release</li>

      <li class="li">Exploratory development for a future
      release</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p class="p">All of these timelines can work in parallel, each in
  a different state. Each timeline can have one or more iterations
  in which some set of deliverables and functional improvements are
  committed.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You can also create
    separate project areas to manage different activities related
    to the same artifacts, and one project area can reference
    artifacts from another. For example, if your team has developed
    a code base in a development project area, you can create a
    separate project area to maintain the same code. This is done
    in the stream editor in the maintenance project by replacing a
    component with a component from a snapshot in the development
    project. This enables the maintenance team to work on the same
    code artifacts but with completely different process
    iterations, roles, rules, and work items.
  </div>

  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Project teams as team areas</h2>

  <p class="p">The structure of the project teams is defined by one
  or more team areas. Complex projects can have a hierarchy of team
  areas. Typically, one or more teams are assigned to each line of
  development. Users might have multiple assignments that require
  them to work on more than one team. Some members, such as the
  project lead, might not belong to a team area, but are defined as
  members at the project level in the project area overview.</p>

  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Projects without team areas</h2>

  <p class="p">You can create a project area that does not include
  any team areas. Typically, this type of project area might be
  appropriate for a small team of developers who want to get up and
  running quickly and do not need to organize their work into
  multiple teams. The Simple Team process template defines a
  project area without team areas. You can also create a process
  template that does not specify team areas.</p>

  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Project process</h2>

  <p class="p">Process is the collection of practices, rules, and
  guidelines used to organize and control the flow of work. The
  project process is defined in a project area and can be further
  customized in a team area, timeline, and iteration. In
  Jazz&trade;, you use process to define user roles and their
  permissions for performing operations within the tool, such as
  changing the state of a work item. Because each component in Jazz
  is process aware, you can add operation behavior rules in the
  form of preconditions and follow-up actions.</p>

  <p class="p">Process is typically based on a template and then
  modified to meet the overall project and team area needs. The
  basic process structure is defined as a set of timelines and
  iterations in the project area overview. Process details for
  roles, permissions, reports, work items types and workflows,
  operation behavior preconditions and follow-up actions can be
  customized in the process configuration.</p>

  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Project schedule as iterations</h2>

  <p class="p">The project schedule is specified by process
  iterations, which represent intervals in the life of the project.
  Each set of iterations is specific to one line of development.
  Teams can configure iterations in a hierarchy; for example a
  timeline could have multiple milestone iterations. Each of those
  milestones could contain one or more phase iterations. The
  iteration hierarchy and names are user-defined.</p>

  <p class="p">You can define the timelines and an iteration
  hierarchy in the project area overview. The overview contains
  controls for adding timelines, start and end dates for iterations
  and a designation for the current iteration. After iterations are
  defined, work items can be assigned to an iteration and tracked
  in an iteration plan.</p>

  <div class="example">
  <h2 class="title">Example project area</h2>

  <p class="p">The following graphic provides an example of a
  project area that has team areas and process configurations that
  are specific to timelines and their iterations. The project area
  can include some users, such as administrators, project managers,
  and business analysts, at the project level; others users are
  added to team areas. The process specification includes
  project-wide roles, permissions, and process behaviors; these are
  inherited by all iterations within the project area. Other roles,
  permissions, and behaviors are defined at the timeline or
  iteration level; these override the project-level process
  configuration. Team members are assigned roles that have specific
  permissions, as defined in the process specification.</p>
