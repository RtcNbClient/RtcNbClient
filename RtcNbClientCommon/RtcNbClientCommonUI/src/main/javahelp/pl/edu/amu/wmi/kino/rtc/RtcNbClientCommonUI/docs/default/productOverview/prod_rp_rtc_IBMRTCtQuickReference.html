   <span class="keyword">Rational Team Concert </span> terminology and
  concepts</h2>
  <p class="p">
   <span class="keyword">Rational Team
  Concert&#8482; </span> artifacts are stored in a 
  <strong class="b">repository </strong>, which can be accessed only
  by authorized 
  <strong class="b">users </strong>.</p>
  <p class="p">The repository contains 
  <strong class="b">project areas </strong>that reference the
  artifacts for a project. Each project area has an associated 
  <strong class="b">process </strong>, which governs how the project
  is run and customizes the way Jazz&#8482; behaves. The process is
  defined by a process configuration and a process description. The
  process configuration defines the project's 
  <strong class="b">iterations </strong>and how it behaves during
  these iterations. The process description corresponds to a Web
  site explaining the process.</p>
  <p class="p"></p>
  <div class="image"></div>
  <img alt="This diagram shows the high-level relationship between project areas, team areas, streams, repository workspaces, and other team artifacts."
  class="image" src="../images/proj_area_streams.gif" />
  <p class="p">There are several predefined processes to choose
  from: Scrum, OpenUp, and Simple. But you can also define your own
  processes or modify an existing one. For more information, see 
  <a class="xref" href="../usingRTC/UseRTC_proj_a_WorkingWithProcessTemplates.html"
  title="Process templates provide a starting point and guide for a project area process configuration and iteration structure. They can include process documentation in HTML format. You apply a process template when you create a project area; the process can then be modified in the project area or its team areas, independent of the template.">
  Process templates</a>.</p>
  <p class="p">From within a project area, you have access to the
  project's artifacts.</p>
  <p class="p">Project Areas are decomposed into a set of 
  <strong class="b">team areas </strong>, which describe the teams
  that work on the project. Each team area has a list of team
  members and the process role they play within the team. A user
  can be a member of more than one team. Each team area can define
  process customizations to tailor the process for the team and its
  subteams.</p>
  <p class="p">For simple projects, all activity is on a single,
  main 
  <strong class="b">timeline </strong>with a single stream.
  Additional timelines can be created for things like maintenance
  activities. Each timeline has its own team areas and process
  customizations.</p>
  <p class="p">The planned work is described by 
  <strong class="b">work items </strong>. The types of work items
  used in a project area are defined by the process. For example,
  the Scrum process defines the following work item types:</p>
  <div class="p">
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Defect</li>
      <li class="li">Task</li>
      <li class="li">Story</li>
      <li class="li">Epic</li>
      <li class="li">Track Build Item</li>
      <li class="li">Impediment</li>
      <li class="li">Adoption Item</li>
      <li class="li">Retrospective</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p class="p">Each work item type can have its own state
  transitions and custom fields. Work items are filed against 
  <strong class="b">work item categories </strong>, which allow you
  to organize work items by functional areas. Each project area
  defines the list of available work item categories. Each team
  area is associated with the work item category for the functional
  area for which the team is responsible.</p>
  <p class="p">You can find work items by executing 
  <strong class="b">queries </strong>. Queries can be private for
  you or shared with the team.</p>
  <p class="p">The work in a project area is done in a sequence of 
  <strong class="b">iterations </strong>. Each iteration can have a
  start and end date. One of the iterations is defined as the
  current one by the process. When planning the work, you target a
  work item for a particular iteration. You can plan all the work
  that should go into an iteration by creating an 
  <strong class="b">iteration plan </strong>. You can plan the
  overall work for a release that is broken down into iterations in
  a 
  <strong class="b">release plan </strong>.</p>
  <p class="p">You use a personal 
  <strong class="b">repository workspace </strong>to work on project
  files that are under source control. You load the repository
  workspace to copy the files and folders on your computer. The 
   <span class="keyword">Jazz Team Server </span> tracks all changes
  made to source-controlled files with 
  <strong class="b">change sets </strong>. Each change set contains
  changed files and folders, carries a comment, and references the
  associated work items that motivated the changes. You check in
  your change sets to upload the modified files and folders from
  your IDE workspace to the repository workspace. Checked-in change
  sets are stored in the repository, but are not yet shared with
  the rest of the development team until you deliver the change
  sets. The check-in and deliver process provides extra protection
  for your changes, while giving you the flexibility to continually
  make changes without delivering immediately.</p>
  <p class="p">Teams use a 
  <strong class="b">stream </strong>to store the master copy of
  project files; each repository workspace holds a copy. A
  repository workspace and the team's stream are connected by a
  flow. You deliver change sets from your repository workspace to
  the stream to incorporate your changes into the master copy;
  these are outgoing change sets. Incoming change sets are those
  that have been delivered to the stream by other team members. You
  accept incoming change sets to incorporate their changes into
  your repository workspace and your IDE workspace.</p>
  <p class="p">The source-controlled file base is built up from the
  steady accumulation of change sets, each one building on
  everything that has come before it. The change history is the
  sequence of change sets for a repository workspace or stream.</p>
  <p class="p">The source-controlled file base can be partitioned
  into one or more separate 
  <strong class="b">components </strong>, each with their own tree
  of folders and files, and their own change history. Simple
  repository workspaces and streams consist of a single component.
  Multiple components are useful for teams building layered
  software in which the pieces evolve semi-independently and are
  deployed separately.</p>
  <p class="p">You create a 
  <strong class="b">baseline </strong>of an individual component in
  a repository workspace to capture an interesting point in time,
  or create a 
  <strong class="b">snapshot </strong>to capture simultaneous
  baselines across all components.</p>
  <p class="p">Each team can have its own 
  <strong class="b">build </strong>, described in a 
  <strong class="b">build definition </strong>associated with the
  team area. The build definition specifies the build interval,
  which build script to use, and which repository workspace to be
  used for fetching files. A build can be run on different 
  <strong class="b">build engines </strong>. A build can be promoted
  to a release. Users can then file work items against a particular
  release.</p>
  <p class="p">You can use 
  <strong class="b">feeds </strong>to be aware of what your
  colleagues are working on, or what's happening on other teams. As
  artifacts in the repository are modified, event notices are
  automatically sent out to the feeds.
