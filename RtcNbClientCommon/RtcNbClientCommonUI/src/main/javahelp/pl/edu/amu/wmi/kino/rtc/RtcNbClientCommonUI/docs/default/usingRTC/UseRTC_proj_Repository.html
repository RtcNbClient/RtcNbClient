  <h1 class="topictitle1">Repository</h1><a name="conbody" id=
  "conbody"></a>Jazz&trade; includes an extensible repository that
  provides a central location for tool-specific information. Data
  is stored in the repository in terms of top-level objects called
  items.

  <p class="p">The repository includes auditable item types, which
  maintain a history of an item's creation and subsequent
  modification for audit purposes. The audit trail includes a
  record of past states of the item, the user who saved the item,
  and the time of the change. For item types which do not require
  audit history, the repository retains only the latest state of
  the item.</p>

  <p class="p">Each item in the repository has a unique identifier,
  which can be used as a key to retrieve it. These universally
  unique identifiers (UUIDs) are applied to items, item states, and
  content values. Therefore when content is replicated from one
  repository to another it retains its unique identity.</p>

  <p class="p">The repository component provides server-side API
  methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting items in
  the repository. The server-side API includes operations for
  running complex queries for items in the repository, based on
  their properties and relationships.</p>

  <p class="p">Jazz also provides a feed service that is backed by
  the repository. Components report change events using a
  server-side API to announce events, such as the completion of a
  build or a delivery to a stream. Change events are recorded in
  the repository. The feed service publishes a Web feed (either
  Atom or RSS), suitable for parsing by a standards-compliant feed
  reader.</p>

  <div class="p">
    The repository is supported by a relational database. Jazz
    currently supports the following relational database management
    systems:

    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Apache Derby, an open source relational
      database system most suited for small repositories.</li>

      <li class="li">IBM&reg; DB2&reg;, a commercially available
      product which offers solutions for repositories of various
      sizes.</li>

      <li class="li">Oracle.</li>

      <li class="li">SQL Server.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p class="p">Creating, updating, and deleting items in a
  repository can only be done using the server-side mechanisms. The
  repository provides a client-side item manager that helps
  coordinate client elements, such as views and editors, with items
  in the repository.</p>

  <p class="p">For more details about the repository, see the "Jazz
  Platform Technical Overview," which is available for registered
  users on www.jazz.net at the Learn page.</p>
