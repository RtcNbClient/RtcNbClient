  <h1 class="topictitle1">Behavior</h1>Process behavior defines
  preconditions and follow-up actions for individual operations.
  This behavior encourages or enforces process rules for your
  project and your teams. Behavior is defined in the project's
  process configuration and can be customized by team areas.

  <p class="p">Preconditions and follow-up actions are applied in
  the context of an operation. For example, for the <strong class=
  "b">Work Item Save</strong> operation, you can use a precondition
  to define which fields in a work item must be filled in before it
  can be saved. If a required field is incomplete, then the save
  operation is blocked and details are provided in the Team Advisor
  view and in the title bar of the work item. The following figure
  provides an example of a precondition that must be met before
  delivering code to source control.</p>

  alerts are displayed in the Team Advisor view</span>

  <div class="image"></div><img alt=
  "This picture shows an alert in the Team Advisor view. A deliver operation has failed, and the alert tells the user that the operation failed because they failed to associate a work item with the change set."
  class="image" src="../images/save_operation_advisor.gif" /></div>

  <p class="p">Follow-up actions can make additional changes to
  artifacts in the repository after an operation is successfully
  completed, as defined by the process. For example, The Scrum
  process currently generates three work items in response to the
  operation of joining a team: <strong class="b">Create a
  Repository Workspace</strong> , <strong class="b">Find Your Work
  Items</strong> , and <strong class="b">Set Up Instant
  Messaging</strong> .</p>

  <p class="p">Jazz&trade; process templates include a collection
  of process operations with preconditions and follow-up actions.
  The predefined operations vary in the different process
  templates. The table below shows operations in the Scrum process
  template, as an example; some of these operations are common to
  all predefined process templates.</p>

  <p class="p">Process permissions and behavior are configured
  independently. Your team can choose to customize only an
  operation's permissions, only the behavior, or both.</p>

  <p class="p">Process permissions and behavior can be shared
  across multiple iterations and timelines, and they can be
  configured at any level of the team configuration. The process
  framework uses the permissions and behavior configured for the
  most specific iteration. For example, if your team defines
  behavior at the top level, that behavior applies for all
  iterations. But if your team then adds a reference to a specific
  iteration and configures the behavior for that iteration, this
  behavior is used when that iteration is current.</p>
